# ppm-steganography-in-c

For the 1st coursework of Hardware-Software interface we have been given instruction to create a program 
that would be used for encoding a message into an image in .ppm format, and retrieve it.

Instructions, design choices, data structures used and algorithms used can be found in steg_report.md              
The program source has been encrypted in steg.zip due to plagiarism.
